Once Mochi has been installed, you will need to add a module to view your external content.[^1]

Modules are bundled into a remote repository, which can then be installed via Mochi. This also allows updating modules within the app.

To find public modules and repositories, you can search them on the Discord {<a target='_blank' href={DISCORD_LINK}>server</a>}.
Or if you would like to build a module you can go to the next page.

## DISCLAIMER

**Keep in mind that modules can execute arbitrary code within the app.** This means that you should always take precaution when you are adding an unknown module to Mochi.

[^1]: In the future, you will be able to import local modules and local content from your device.
