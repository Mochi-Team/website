## Installation

Mochi can be installed using TestFlight or manual installation.

### TestFlight Installation
1. Download and join [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/d960sZAm)
2. Install Mochi 

### Manual Installation
As of now you will need to clone the [GitHub](https://github.com/Mochi-Team/mochi) repo and use Xcode to install
the app on your device. Soon I will release compiled IPAs once TestFlight is close to being full.
