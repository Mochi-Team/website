## Installation

Mochi can be installed via TestFlight or manual installation.

### TestFlight Installation

1. Download and join {<a target='_blank' href={TESTFLIGHT_LINK}>TestFlight</a>}
2. Install Mochi

### Manual Installation

As of now you will need to clone the [GitHub](https://github.com/Mochi-Team/mochi) repo and use Xcode to install
the app on your device. Soon I will release compiled IPAs once TestFlight is close to being full.

### Troubleshooting
