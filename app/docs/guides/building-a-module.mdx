A module allows retrieving content from an external source. This may be a Jellyfin instance, your own server, whichever!

With this, there are still things that must be considered before building a module:
* Any module you develop is not associated with Mochi.
* TBA

Each module must correspond to a repository in order to receive any module updates.
In the future I will allow users to install a single module without a repository.

## Tools

These tools will help you build a module:
* [cli](https://github.com/mochi-team/cli): A tool used to bundle modules and generate repository.
* [js](https://github.com/mochi-team/js): TypeScript bindings for developing modules.
* [runner](https://github.com/mochi-team/runner): A test runner used to debug Mochi modules using node.
* [Mochi](https://github.com/mochi-team/mochi): The app itself.
